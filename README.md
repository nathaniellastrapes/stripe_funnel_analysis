# Stripe Funnel Conversion Analysis  
*Data Analyst Portfolio Project by Nathaniel Lastrapes*

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates and analyzes a user onboarding funnel similar to what Stripe might observe when acquiring new users. It tracks users through key funnel stages: email verification, business info submission, KYC completion, and first payment—to uncover drop-off points and revenue performance across different segments.

The goal of this analysis is to replicate real-world product analytics and provide actionable insights that could support business strategy, marketing, and product optimization at a company like Stripe.
